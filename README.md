# Blockchain Authentication with .NET MAUI

## Overview

This repository contains the code for implementing blockchain authentication using Ethereum and WalletConnect within a .NET MAUI app, as described in the blog post. The solution utilizes the "Sign-In with Ethereum" (SIWE) protocol to create a decentralized authentication system without traditional credentials.

## Features
- **Blockchain-based authentication** using Ethereum
- **WalletConnect integration** for secure login
- Example of **decentralized login** with SIWE protocol
